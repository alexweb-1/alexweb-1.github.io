          <h5>What is a Coding Champion?</h5>
          <p>A Coding Champion is a parent who, like us, believes that learning to code should be an essential part of every child’s development. They believe technology is the future. They believe that it’s our responsibility to provide opportunities for our kids to develop the skills they’ll need in an environment built for learning.</p>
          <p>A Coding Champion is an advocate for bringing coding programs into schools so more kids can be exposed to computer programming, robotics, and technology education.</p>
          <p>Want to learn how you can partner with CodeAdvantage to advance coding education in your child’s school and beyond? <a href="#">Fill out our contact form</a> or send us an <a href="#">email</a>. We’d love to hear from you.</p>
